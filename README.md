# Earlier Mythic level ups mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Adds mythic level up on Xanthir's death.   
Removes mythic level up from Colyphyr.

Adds mythic level up to Deskari fight in Act 5.    
Removes mythic level up from Threshold.

Known issues: if you actually take (not just gain) MR9 before you complete mythic quest in A5, you won't get to pick mythic portrait. This is too annoying to fix.
